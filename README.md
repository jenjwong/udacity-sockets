## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine clone the repository and in both the root directory and client directory execute:
```
npm i
```
From the root directory start the development environment by running:
```
npm run dev
```
To streamline development the project uses [Facebook's Create React App.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Tests

This application implements basic testing with Enzyme, and Jest. [Mock-sockets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-socket) is used to mock out sockets.

To execute the test suite, in the client directory run:
```
npm run test
```
